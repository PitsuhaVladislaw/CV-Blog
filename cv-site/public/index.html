                            I have one main goal, I want to become a Front-end developer, I really like to develop and create websites of various
                            formats (from guidebooks to something new). I like to work in a team, I am purposeful and complete all tasks, I like to
                            bring the work to the very end. I have no work experience, I'm still learning, but I have a strong motivation, I deeply
                            admire Front-end developers and the way they do projects in a team, it's attractive and you just can't try it yourself,
                            work hard and improve your skills and knowledge . My dream is to become a front end developer and work in a team of
                            other developers on various projects.
